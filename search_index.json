The following conventions must be adhered to:\n\nThe external file should have a .js extension\nYou do not need to use the  tag in the external .js file \n\n\nBelow we include demo_script_src.js which lives int he scripts folder\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n  ....\n\n\n"},"sessions/session2/event_listener.html":{"url":"sessions/session2/event_listener.html","title":"Adding Event Listeners","keywords":"","body":"Adding Event Listeners\nAlthough we've not formally introduced the concept, we've already used javaScript event driven capabilities.  Remember this bit of code:\nThe HTML\n  Click Me \n\nThe javaScript\nfunction showName(){\n    // insert instructions    \n} //end function\n\nIn the above example we're listening for a click event via the implementation of onClick=\"showName() attribute. The browser will then invoke the function showName(), when the click event occurs. Functions that react to events are known as event handlers.\njavaScript Events\nSo far, we've only looked at one event, onClick. There are however dozens of different events that we can react to. Here are some of the most common:\n\n\n\nEvent\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nonchange\nAn HTML element has been changed . E.G. a form has been updated\n\n\nonclick\nThe user clicks an HTML element\n\n\nonmouseover\nThe user moves the mouse over an HTML element\n\n\nonmouseout\nThe user moves the mouse away from an HTML element\n\n\nonkeydown\nThe user pushes a keyboard key\n\n\nonload\nThe browser has finished loading the page\n\n\n\nAdding Event Listeners\nThere are two main ways to add event listeners: \n\nUsing an inline attribute to add a call back function (up to this point how we've added event listeners)\nAdding an the event listener using javaScript \n\nJust like with HTML we want to, where possible, avoid the use of inline elements. Therefore, in most cases it's advantageous to add event listeners using javaScript. \nWe've seen the below example before, however we're now adding the callback using javaScript and also using an external .js file\n\n\ndemo.html\n\n\n\n    \n                  \n    \n     \n    \n            \n             \n             Click Me     \n             \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nscripts/event_demo.js\n\n\n/**\n    Main Function is invoked when the html \n    page has loaded\n\n**/\nfunction main() {\n    //reference an html element \n    var myButton = document.getElementById(\"button\");\n     //myButton holds a reference to our button element \n    //we can now add a on click event \n    myButton.addEventListener(\"click\", buttonClicked)\n\n}\n\n/**\n  buttonClicked call back function \n**/\n\nfunction buttonClicked() {\n   //get the value entered into the user name     \n   var myUserName = document.getElementById(\"userName\").value \n   //ouput to our p tag \n   document.getElementById(\"output\").innerHTML = \"Hello \" + myUserName;\n}\n\nIn the above example notice how clean our HTML is. The only inline event listener we add is  this effectively initiates our program when the document has loaded. Also note when we set up an event listener using javascript we can omit  the \"on\" for the event name. \n myButton.addEventListener(\"click\", buttonClicked)  //onclick becomes click\n\n"},"sessions/session2/exercise1.html":{"url":"sessions/session2/exercise1.html","title":"Exercise 1  - Session 1 Recap","keywords":"","body":"Exercise 1  -  Recap\nExtend the demo program presented in Session 1 Recap so it includes a second input box for age.

It's also going to be an opportunity to refresh your HTML skills along the way.\n1) Create An HTML Template\nFirst things first, make an HTML template that will form the foundation of our clock. Create a file called index.html and create your layout.  Here's what mine looks like:\n\nMake sure that you have a neat folder structure and place your css rulesin an external .css file.\n2) Implement the javaScript date object\nYou'll need this for your assessment\n1) Create a javascript file called main.js and place it in a a folder called scripts.\n2) Include the external js file into your HTML page\n3) Set up an onload event in your html file to call a function called main() within your HTML's document's  tag.\n4) In order create a clock the first thing we need to do is get the current time. Luckily, javaScript has a handy date object we can use.\n// set up a new date object \n  var today = new Date();\n  //extract the hour min and seconds and store them in a variable \n  var curr_hour = today.getHours();\n  var curr_minute = today.getMinutes();\n  var curr_second = today.getSeconds();\n\nInclude the above code into your main() function.\n2) In your main function, declare a variable curr_time and assign it the concatenated values of  curr_hour , curr_minute and curr_second  separated by a \":\".\nAdd the instruction console.log(current_time); in your main() function, this will print the value of current time to the console.You should see something similar to below in the google chrome developer tools console.\n\n5) Attache the time and date to the HTML document\nUsing docment.getElementeById(\"insertid\").innerHtml = insert the current time into your HTML clock.\n6) Let's start time\nCurrently  the only way to get the up to date time is to refresh the page, this is not ideal.  Lets fix this:\n1) Create a  below the clock and give it an ID.\n2) Within the main.js  main function add an event listener that calls a function startTime when the button is clicked.\n3) In order to actually make the clock tick, we need to repeatedly call the main function. To achieve this we can use the    setInterval() function:\n// call the function main every 500 mills\n   setInterval(main, 500);\n\nThe above example will call the function main() every 500 milliseconds. Include something similar in your button click callBack function.\nYour clock should now update in real time, but only after the button is clicked\nWhen your done show your tutor to check that you have implemented all of the concepts correctly\n"},"sessions/session2/exercise4.html":{"url":"sessions/session2/exercise4.html","title":"Exercise 4 - Advanced Chat Application","keywords":"","body":"Exercise 4 (Advanced Project)\n\nCreate a firebase chat application, users should be able to log-in using Facebook oAuth. \n\nYou will need to set up a firebase account https://firebase.google.com/\n\nUse the firebase documentation and my sample app as a starting point \n\nWork out how to set up authentication, so you can use Facebook/Google to login \n\nWhen complete, publish to firebase hosting or GitHub pages and send me the link\n\n\n"},"sessions/session3/introduction.html":{"url":"sessions/session3/introduction.html","title":"Session 3 - Website Design Choices","keywords":"","body":"Session4  - Making Design Choice For Your Website\nThis week we're going to be looking at some basic design choices that you can make for your websites.

You may want to make use of the following operators:\n\n\n\nOperator\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n==\nequal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal\n\n\n>\ngreater than\n\n\n\nless than\n\n\n>=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n\nless than or equal to\n\n\n\nWe can only have 1 else with every if. If we want to specify more than one alternative then we have to use else if.\nConsider the following example:\nif (role == \"teacher\"){\n\n    console.log(\"You are a teacher!\");\n\n}\n\nelse if (role == \"Student\"){\n\n    console.log(\"You are a student!\");\n\n}\n\nelse if (role == \"Admin\"){\n\n    console.log(\"Your are an admin\");\n\n}\n\nelse{\n\n     console.log(\"I don’t know what you are!\");\n\n}\nIn the above example you will notice that an else if statement is used to specify alternative paths and that you can have more than 1 else if  statement. In fact, you can have as many else if statements as you like.\nMultiple conditions\n You can join together different conditions with \"or” or “and” statements, to test whether either statement is true, or both are true, respectively.\nIn JavaScript “or” is written as || and “and” is written as &&.\nSay you want to test if the value of x is between 10 and 20—you could do that with a condition stating:\nif(x > 10 && x If you want to make sure that country is either “England” or “Germany” you use:\nif(country === 'England' || country === 'Germany') {\n    ...\n}\nSection Exercise\nExercise 1 if\n\n\tExercise\n\t\n\t    Correct!\n\t\n\n\t\n\t    False!\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\nFill up the value of `name` to validate the condition.\n\n\t\n\tvar name =\n\nif (name === \"John\") {\n\n}\n\n\tvar name = \"John\";\n\nif (name === \"John\") {\n\n}\n\tassert(name === \"John\");\n\t\n\n\t\n\t    Submit\n\t    Solution\n\t\n\nExercise 2 else\n\n\tExercise\n\t\n\t    Correct!\n\t\n\n\t\n\t    False!\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\nFill up the value of `name` to validate the `else` condition.\n\n\t\n\tvar name =\n\nif (name === \"John\") {\n\n} else if (name === \"Aaron\") {\n    // Valid this condition\n}\n\n\tvar name = \"Aaron\";\n\nif (name === \"John\") {\n\n} else if (name === \"Aaron\") {\n    // Valid this condition\n}\n\tassert(name === \"Aaron\");\n\t\n\n\t\n\t    Submit\n\t    Solution\n\t\n\nExercise 3 multiple conditions\n\n\tExercise\n\t\n\t    Correct!\n\t\n\n\t\n\t    False!\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\nFill up the 2 conditions so that `primaryCategory` equals `\"E/J\"` only if name equals `\"John\"` and country is `\"England\"`, and so that `secondaryCategory` equals `\"E|J\"` only if name equals `\"John\"` or country is `\"England\"`\n\n\t\n\tvar name = \"John\";\nvar country = \"England\";\nvar primaryCategory, secondaryCategory;\n\nif ( /* Fill here */ ) {\n    primaryCategory = \"E/J\";\n}\nif ( /* Fill here */ ) {\n    secondaryCategory = \"E|J\";\n}\n\n\tvar name = \"John\";\nvar country = \"England\";\nvar primaryCategory, secondaryCategory;\n\nif (name === \"John\" && country === \"England\") {\n    primaryCategory = \"E/J\";\n}\nif (name === \"John\" || country === \"England\") {\n    secondaryCategory = \"E|J\";\n}\n\tassert(primaryCategory === \"E/J\" && secondaryCategory === \"E|J\");\n\t\n\n\t\n\t    Submit\n\t    Solution\n\t\n\n"},"sessions/session6/arrays.html":{"url":"sessions/session6/arrays.html","title":"Arrays in JavaScript","keywords":"","body":"Arrays\nYou should already be aware of the following types of variables in javaScript:\nvar  myNumber = 42;    //  is a Number\nvar  myString = \"bar\"; //  is a string\nvar  myBoolean = true;  // is a boolean\nThe limitations of the above data types are they can hold a single value.\nJavaScript arrays allow us to store multiple values in a single variable.\nExample\nvar courses = [\"CDA401\", \"SWD500\", \"CDA601\"];\nAccessing Arrays\nEach element has an assigned index number starting from 0\n\nExercise\n\n\tExercise\n\t\n\t    Correct!\n\t\n\n\t\n\t    False!\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\nComplete the below function wordString is equal to 'I study at Solent'\n\n\t\n\tvar solentArray = ['at', 'study', 'Solent', 'I'];\nvar wordString  = ;//complete this section don't forget to include the spaces\n\n\tvar wordString  =  solentArray[3] + solentArray[1] + solentArray[0] + solentArray[2];\n\tassert(wordString  === \"I study at Solent\");\n\t\n\n\t\n\t    Submit\n\t    Solution\n\t\n\n"},"sessions/session6/functions.html":{"url":"sessions/session6/functions.html","title":"Functions","keywords":"","body":"Functions in javaScript\nWe've already seen and used javaScript functions is this course.

If the user runs out of guesses it is game over. The inputs should then be hidden. \n"},"sessions/session6/exercise3.html":{"url":"sessions/session6/exercise3.html","title":"Advanced Exercise","keywords":"","body":"A Monty Hall simulation\nThis task is advanced and there will be a few programming constructs such as loops and arrays that we have not covered yet. While you'll need to some exploratory learning, this task will really help cement the principles we have learned so far.\nModelling the Monty Hall Problem\nFirst, ensure you fully understand the game:\nSuppose you're on a game show and you are given the choice of three doors. \n1) Player picks a door2) Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats3) The car and the goats were placed randomly behind the doors before the show4) The game show host, Monty Hall, who knows what is behind the doors, now has to open one of the two remaining doors, and the door he opens must have a goat behind it5) He will ask you to decide whether you want to stay with your   first choice or to switch to the last remaining door6) Should you stick or switch? \nThe question Should you stick or switch? is the question we are trying to answer using a javaScript simulation.  \nSet up\n\nCreate index.html and game.js include game.js into your html file \n\nWithin game.js define the following variables at the top of the file\nvar pick; // to hold the simulated pick\nvar gameArray; // to hold the game array \nvar revealedDoor; // hold the revealed door\nvar stickWins = 0; //number of wins by sticking \nvar switchWins = 0; // of wins by switching\n\n\n\nCreate a function getRandomArbitrary(min, max) which returns a random number between any given range.  \n\n\nDefine a function game() this function will contain a single run through of our game. \nFor now, it should just do the following:\n-  set `gameArray` equal to  `['goat', 'goat', 'goat']`;\n\nusing getRandomArbitrary(min, max) it should set a single entry of gameArray\nto a 'car'. Hint a function that resolves to a integer can be used to pick an array location \ngameArray[someFunction()] = 'foo''  \n\nto model the player pick, use getRandomArbitrary(min, max) and set  pick equal to a random number between\n0 and 1. Remember that array indexes start at 0.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now need to simulate the game show host opening a door. Recall, he knows which door has the car behind it and opens the remaining door with the goat. We therefore need to find a location in the game array that is not the pick and does not contain the car:\n-  To achieve the above complete the condition on the blow function, then place the function in your code. \n    function openDoor() {\n        for (var i = 0; i    2) You can now add revealedDoor = openDoor(); to your game() function\n\n\n6) After revealing the door we now need to simulate the two scenarios of sticking or switching and measure if the car has been won for each of these scenarios:\n\nIf gameArray[pick] is equal to the car increase stick by        \nTo measure the affect of a contestant switching is a bit harder. We need to write and \n  use a function called `switchDoor()` which will return a `gameArray` location that is:\n\n   - Not the picked door \n   - Not the revealed door\nThere are a number of ways of achieving this, perhaps the easiest is using a series of if statements to consider every possible player choice (there are only three) against the revealed door. We can use a nested if statement for this, you'll need 3 in total. This is a little bit tricky, considering the following might help:\n\n\nAs a hint, I've completed the scenario of a the pick being 0 for you. Complete the below function by adding scenarios for 1 and 2\nfunction switchDoor() {\n\n    if (pick == 0)  {\n        if (revealedDoor == 1) {\n            return 2;\n        } else {\n            return 1;\n        }\n     }   \n\n}\n7) Write a loop that runs the game function 1000 times and logs the amount of stick wins and switch wins\n8) Add a graphical interface to show the outcome\n"}}}
